## Hi! This is Kartik Bindra üëãüèª

A little about me, I'm a dedicated software engineer skilled in Full-Stack development, Blockchain development, and UI/UX Design, focused on building impactful and scalable solutions. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can apply my skills in coding, problem-solving, and design to build impactful projects. More about me here: [Check out my Portfolio](https://kartikbindra.xyz)

## Task Submission

Now, Lets talk about the Task Submission (‚Äôcause that is what you are here for anyways!)

So I will go through the **approach** I took to implement the asked functionalities, **what I learnt** along the way in contrast to **what I already knew** and the deeper understanding of all the things (& how they work under the hood). Here I go!

## üîê Next.js Authentication using JWT

Instead of going the easy route with third-party libraries (like Auth.js), I decided to build the auth logic from scratch using **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens). Why? Because understanding how things actually work is _chef‚Äôs kiss_ for any real dev. ü§åüèª

### What I Already Knew

- JWT-based auth in a React + Express.js Setup
- Access Token (Client Side Token) & Refresh Token (Server Side Token) in JWT Authentication
- Zod Form data validation
- Connecting serverless databases like NeonDB

### What I Learned

- Implementing JWT with the `jose` library in a Next.js app
- Creating custom middlewares for auth logic
- Realizing that Access Tokens aren‚Äôt necessary in a full Next.js setup (since it handles both client & server)
- `useActionState()` hook

## Architecture

I would like to explain the 2 different approaches for authentication with JWT. One that used React with a Express.js Server and the other using Next.js Client and Server Actions. Lets see both of them:

### React + Server Based Authentication with JWT

### Next.js Authentication with JWT (Server Actions + Middleware)

Look at the designs of Auth pages & workflows here: [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/design/QIksBzXkb9gaLg7Iq9BoxW/kx-submission_KartikBindra?node-id=0-1&t=I1JlaxZ2XkbwqqaV-1)

## üé® Blob Gradient Dynamic Background

Reverse engineering this gradient was hell of a task to be completed. What helped me the most was the browser inspect tbh üëÄ

### What I Observed

The [kraftedX.com](https://kraftedx.com) website had 6 Blobs/circles/divs that were moving around the whole background space with different animations applied to them: Circular Rotation Animation, Horizontal & Vertical Animations. Each blob had a gradient applied to it. Every blob had a functionality that helped them ‚Äúgravitate‚Äù towards the cursor whenever they were close to it. (or maybe vice versa, the cursor blob was getting gravitated towards the blobs whenever they were close enough!)

### What I Built

I implemented the animated background using 6 circular divs and a cursor pointer div. I applied almost similar animations to the blobs that I found on the KraftedX website. Although I was not able to figure out the magnetic/ gravitating effect of the blobs and the mouse pointer.

> Would love to work "gravitate" feature too, but had to leave it due to upcoming end-semester examination pressure, IYKYK! ü•≤

Want to see the animations in action? Visit the Home and interact with the background there. Hope you like it!

Thanks for checking out my submission. Hope it gave you a peek into how I approach problems and build solutions that are equal parts functional and delightful.

**Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed the walkthrough**
